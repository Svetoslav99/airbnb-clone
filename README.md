This is an Airbnb Clone written in Next.js 13, Tailwind, Prisma, MongoDB, NextAuth.js.

The idea behind this demo project was to follow an extensive tutorial on how Next.js changed from v.12 to v.13 - everything from experimental /app folder, changes in the /api endpoint handling and the extensive use of server components and actions.
